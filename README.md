# Thermalization from Quenching in Coupled Harmonic Oscillators

This repository contains the Mathematica notebooks developed for the research project  
**“Thermalization from Quenching in Coupled Harmonic Oscillators”**.

## Contents
- `thermalization.nb` – Main Mathematica notebook with detailed explanations
- `thermalization.pdf` – Read-only PDF version of the notebook for viewing without Mathematica

## Description
The project explores **quench-induced finite-time thermalization** in a system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. The notebook includes all calculations, plots, and step-by-step explanations used in the research.

## Usage
1. Open `thermalization.nb` in Wolfram Mathematica to reproduce the code.  
2. Alternatively, view `thermalization.pdf` to read the annotated code and explanations without Mathematica.
